A Web-Based Cancer Patient Medical Equipment Renting System is a web-based system for Pertubuhan Pejuang Kanser Melaka (PPKM). There are three users of the system, which are admin, staff and client. Admin can view and delete client and staff account details and manage medical equipment. Admin also can view and update the status application either success or failed. Staff can view and update their details, manage return item and view rental history. Meanwhile for client, client can view and update their account details, view available equipment and create application for renting the medical equipment. Then, client can view status application, upload proof payment and also can view rental history.

## Problem
